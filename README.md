# Hello, my name is Clément 👋

I am a Python developer interested in web, APIs and microservices.

I'm currently working on the infrastructure for my projects.
Therefore, most of my contributions to GitHub will be private for security reasons.
I'll also be working on my portfolio, adding a News section, and posting it online in the future. 
So I can update you once a week on my progress.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
