# Hello, I'm Clément 👋

I'm a Software Engineer focused on backend architectures and AI/data-driven systems.
💼 I'm currently open to work opportunities related to web development, backend engineering, or AI/data systems.

I'm currently working on the infrastructure for my projects.
Therefore, most of my contributions to GitHub will be private for security reasons.
I'll also be working on my portfolio, adding a News section, and posting it online in the future. 
So I can update you once a week on my progress.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
